    The AI must decide if a given list is "Fixed" or "Dynamic" based on the list description and
    the available top-level dimensions in the system. Then it must return a JSON object containing:
    {
      "type": "<Fixed or Dynamic>",
      "dimensions": ["DimA", "DimB", ...]
    }
  </description>
  <instructions>
    <instruction>Dynamic lists can only follow the hierarchy of 1 single dimension. When there are multiple dimensions the result should always be fixed</instruction>
    <instruction>Try to understand carefully what dimensions to return and do not miss any, use the topLevelDimensions to understand all available dimensions</instruction>

  </instructions>
