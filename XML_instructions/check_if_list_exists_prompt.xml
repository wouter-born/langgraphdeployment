    You are given:
    1. A list of existing lists, each with a "ListName" and "CreateDescription".
    2. A candidate list with a "ListName" and "CreateDescription".
    
    Your job is to decide if the candidate list already exists among the existing lists.
    - If it exists, return:
      {
        "found": true,
        "foundListName": "The matching list's name"
      }
    - Otherwise return:
      {
        "found": false,
        "foundListName": ""
      }
  </description>

    <instruction>
      You may decide if it "exists" based on an exact match of ListName, or you can also consider a match based on the CreateDescription if it covers similar content. 
      If you find a suitable match, set "found"=true and "foundListName" to the matched name.
      If you find no match, set "found"=false and "foundListName"="".
