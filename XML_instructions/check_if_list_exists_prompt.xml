    You are given:
    1. A list of existing lists, each with a "ListID", "ListName" and "CreateDescription".
    2. A candidate list with a "ListName" and "CreateDescription".

    Your job is to decide if the candidate list already exists among the existing lists.
    - If it exists, return:
    <![CDATA[
      {
        "found": true,
        "foundListID": "<The matching list's ID>"
      }
    ]]>
    - Otherwise return:
    <![CDATA[
      {
        "found": false,
        "foundListID": ""
      }
    ]]>
  </description>

  <instructions>
    <instruction>
      You may decide if it "exists" based on an exact match of ListName, or you can also consider a match based on the CreateDescription if it covers similar content.
    </instruction>
    <instruction>
      If you find a suitable match, set "found"=true and "foundListID" to the matched list's ID.
      If you find no match, set "found"=false and "foundListID"="".
    </instruction>
    <instruction>
      If there are multiple matches to chose from look carefully at the use case. If a list is to be used on table columns then pick the match where the createDescription mentions it should be used on columns.
    </instruction>
    <instruction>
      Make sure the list qualifies as a match based. 
      For example, when the user asks for Actual, Budget, Variance and Variance Bar, a list with only Actual and Budget should not be considered a match. 
      Also a list specifying more dimensions should not qualify. ("A list with  Net Sales including Actual, Budget, Variance, and a Variance bar to be used on table columns." also contains Account and should not qualify)
